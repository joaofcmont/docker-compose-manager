# 🐳 Built a Visual Docker Compose Editor - Looking for Feedback!

Hey dev community! 👋

I've been wrestling with Docker Compose YAML files for way too long, so I built something to make it easier: **Docker Compose Manager** - a visual editor that lets you build and manage multi-container Docker applications without the YAML headaches.

## The Problem

We've all been there:
- Forgetting the exact YAML syntax
- Spending hours debugging indentation issues
- Copy-pasting configs and hoping they work
- Managing environment variables, volumes, and ports manually

## The Solution

A visual, form-based editor that:
- ✅ **No YAML knowledge required** - Just fill out forms
- ✅ **Live preview** - See your YAML update in real-time as you type
- ✅ **Import existing files** - Upload your docker-compose.yml and edit it visually
- ✅ **Export anytime** - Download your configuration as a ready-to-use YAML file
- ✅ **Free to use** - No sign-up required to try the editor

## What I've Built (MVP)

**Core Features:**
- Visual form-based configuration
- Service templates (Nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Environment variables management
- Volume mapping
- Port configuration
- Health checks
- Resource limits (CPU/Memory)
- Service dependencies
- Multi-service support

## Why I'm Sharing This

This is an **MVP** and I'm looking for honest feedback from the community:
- Does this solve a real problem for you?
- What features are missing?
- What would make you actually use this?
- Any bugs or UX issues?

I've set up a quick waitlist for early access to future features (multi-environment management, team collaboration, etc.), but the editor is **100% free and functional right now** - no sign-up needed.

## Tech Stack

- Angular 18
- Firebase (Firestore + Analytics)
- EmailJS (for contact form)
- Deployed on Vercel

## What's Next?

Based on your feedback, I'm planning:
- Multi-service editing in one view
- Environment-specific configurations
- Team collaboration features
- Integration with Docker Hub
- More service templates
